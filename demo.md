# VeriChain Demo Video Script

> **Duration:** 3-4 minutes  
> **Tone:** Confident, Professional, Impactful  
> **Goal:** Impress judges in first 30 seconds

---

## 🎬 OPENING (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Screen: Landing Page Hero Section]**

> "Imagine a world where your identity isn't controlled by banks, governments, or corporations—but by YOU.

> A world where you can prove you're over 18 without revealing your birthdate. Prove your income without exposing your salary. Prove your education without sharing your personal details.

> This is **VeriChain**—the world's first oracle-powered decentralized identity protocol with **Proof-of-Real-World-Stake**.

> Built exclusively for QIE Blockchain."

---

## 📊 PROBLEM STATEMENT (0:30 - 1:00)

**[Screen: Scroll through Landing Page Features]**

> "Today's identity systems are broken.

> **$400 billion** lost annually to identity fraud. **1.7 billion people** excluded from financial services. And every time you verify your identity, you expose ALL your private data.

> Existing blockchain solutions? They're static. One-time verification that becomes outdated the moment it's created.

> VeriChain solves this with something revolutionary—**dynamic, living identities** that evolve with your real-world behavior."

## 🔧 LIVE DEMO - WALLET CONNECTION (1:00 - 1:30)

**[Screen: Click "Connect Wallet" on Header]**

> "Let me show you how it works.

> First, I connect my MetaMask wallet to QIE Testnet.

**[MetaMask popup appears, approve connection]**

> Connected! Notice the wallet address appearing in the header. We're now on QIE Blockchain—Chain ID 1983."

---

## 🆔 LIVE DEMO - CREATE IDENTITY (1:30 - 2:15)

**[Screen: Navigate to Dashboard → Create Identity]**

> "Now, let's create a decentralized identity.

**[Fill the form with sample data]**

> I enter my credentials—name, email, date of birth. But here's the magic...

**[Click Create Identity]**

> Watch what happens. The data is **AES-256 encrypted** on the frontend. Then uploaded to **IPFS**—completely decentralized storage. And finally, the identity hash is recorded on QIE Blockchain.

**[Transaction confirms]**

> Done! My identity now exists on the blockchain, but my raw data? It's encrypted and only I control it."

## 📈 LIVE DEMO - TRUST SCORE (2:15 - 2:45)

**[Screen: Show Trust Score Section]**

> "Now the innovation that makes VeriChain unique—**Proof-of-Real-World-Stake**.

> Our smart contract connects to ALL **7 QIE native oracles**—Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, XRP, USDT, USDC, and QIE.

**[Show Trust Score calculation]**

> It analyzes my on-chain activity, my asset holdings, cross-chain reputation, and behavioral consistency to generate a **dynamic trust score from 0 to 100**.

> This score updates every 24 hours automatically. It's a living, breathing identity—not a static credential."

---

## 🔐 LIVE DEMO - ZK PROOFS (2:45 - 3:15)

**[Screen: Navigate to ZK Proofs Section]**

> "But what about privacy? This is where Zero-Knowledge Proofs come in.

**[Select Age Verification proof]**

> Let's say a website needs to verify I'm over 18. Instead of revealing my birthdate, I generate a ZK proof.

**[Generate Proof]**

> The proof is created using **Circom circuits** and verified on-chain by our **ZKVerifier** contract.

**[Show verification result]**

> The result? The website knows I'm over 18, but learns **nothing else**. No birthdate. No personal data. Complete privacy."

## 💡 WHY QIE? (3:15 - 3:35)

**[Screen: Show Architecture Diagrams / Help Page]**

> "Why did we build on QIE Blockchain?

> Three words: **Free. Native. Oracles.**

> On Ethereum, these oracle calls would cost **$3,500 per 1,000 verifications** using Chainlink. On QIE? **Completely free.**

> This makes continuous trust scoring economically viable for the first time ever. Plus, **25,000 TPS** and **3-second finality** means seamless user experience."

---

## 🏆 CLOSING (3:35 - 4:00)

**[Screen: Landing Page with Team Section]**

> "VeriChain isn't just another identity solution—it's a paradigm shift.

> **7 production smart contracts**. **65 automated tests**. **5 Zero-Knowledge circuits**. All deployed on QIE Testnet.

> We believe **1.7 billion unbanked people deserve financial inclusion**. We believe **privacy is a fundamental right**. And we believe **QIE Blockchain makes the impossible possible**.

> Thank you.

> I'm Yashodip More, and this is **VeriChain Identity Protocol**."
